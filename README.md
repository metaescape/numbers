`natural.py`, `integer.py`, `rational.py`, `real.py` are the codes for Chapters 2, 4, and 5 of the book "Analysis" by Terence Tao.

`turing_machine/` Contains the code for Turing's 1936 paper.

## How to run the code for the Turing machine

To run the tests for the Turing machine:

- Use `make test-machine`.

To run the tests for the abbreviated table (a high-level language for Turing machines):

- Use `make test-abb`.

To run the tests for the encoding of Turing machines:

- Use `make test-encode`.

To run the tests for the universal Turing machine:

- Use `make test-uni`.

Alternatively, you can manually run the commands in the Makefile.

To run the tests for the reduction of the halting problem:

- Use `make test-reduce`.
